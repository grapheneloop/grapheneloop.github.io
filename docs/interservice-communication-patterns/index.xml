      <description>Basis of Wifi Network Security Media Access Control (MAC) Address ifconfig you may see:
eth0: A physical network card used for LAN Network used in wired connection. wlan0: A physical network adapter used for wireless connection. lo: loopback virtual network interface which lets you use the localhost. This will not have a MAC address. Note: You may see different names for the interface names. The following assumes the name of wireless interface as wlan0 for simplicity &amp;amp; clarity.</description>
